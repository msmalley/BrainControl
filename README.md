# Welcome to BrainControl
### Storing and Sending Bitcoin from Your Brain!

BrainControl is a 100% Browser-Based Bitcoin Wallet.

It requires a browser with HTML5 LocalStorage functionality, and uses inline
JavaScript to generate and manage non-existent private keys using deterministic
methods that combine salts, passwords and PINs. Manage your wallet without
actually storing your Bitcoin anywhere other than in your brain.
